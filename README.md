# Masked Cursor Feature

[Visit](https://masked-cursor.vercel.app/)

## Description
I developed a unique masked cursor that follows the mouse movement across the screen. When the cursor hovers over text elements, it creates a mask that reveals the text in a different color, adding an engaging visual effect. This technique was implemented in the project I created for the [Agency Plexus](https://agenciaplexus.com.br) Plexus, enhancing user interaction and providing a modern, dynamic experience.

## Technologies Used
